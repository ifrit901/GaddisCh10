	 * 10.23 What is the purpose of an interface?
	 * 
	 * answer: An interface specifies behavior for a class. It is like a 
	 * class that only has abstract methods.
	 * 
	 * 10.24 How is an interface similar to an abstract class?
	 * 
	 * answer: An interface is similar to an abstract class in that they both contain
	 * abstract methods and can contain fields.
	 * 
	 * 10.25 How is an interface different from a abstract class, or any class?
	 * 
	 * answer: An interface is different from classes and abstract classes in that 
	 * they cannot be instantiated, the fields must be final and all methods public.
	 * 
	 * 10.26 If an interface has fields, how are they treated? 
	 * 
	 * answer: An interface's fields are always final and static. They must be initialized.
	 * 
	 * 10.27 Write the first line of a class called Customer, which implements 
	 * an interface called Relatable.
	 * 
	 * answer: public class Customer implements Relatable {
	 * 
	 * 10.28 Write the first line of a class called Employee, which implements 
	 * the interfaces Payable and Listable.
	 * 
	 * answer: public class Employee implements Payable, Listable { 
	 *
